The "Google Search" button submits the search query to the Google search engine.
The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button takes users directly to the top result for the search query.
The "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons change color when hovered over.
The search page is fully responsive, meaning it will adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
